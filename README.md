## Tableau Borders

OSM Admin Boundaries for Tableau

### Data

We will focus initially on countries in Africa and places where we work.  We'll continue to expand as time allows.

### Data Source

This project uses admin boundary data from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org).  To get this data we are using the awesome [Mapzen Borders](https://mapzen.com/data/borders/) project.

Why OSM?  OSM admin boundary data is by no means perfect.  However, they represent one of the best non-propietary sources of data out there.   Also, if you use these borders you'll help ensure your maps in Tableau line up perfectly with OSM derived Mapbox base maps.    

By promoting the use of OSM Admin Boundaries, we hope this project like Mapzen Borders provides additonal incentive for people to invest in improving admin boundary coverage in OSM.

### Contribute

If you see a country missing please add it and send a pull request. Alternately, you can contact us via a ticket and we'll help faciliate getting your data added.

To generate these files we are using the very handy R script [TabShapeR](https://github.com/msolbrig/TabShapeR).
