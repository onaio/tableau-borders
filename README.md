## Tableau Borders

OSM Admin Boundaries for Tableau

### Data

We will focus initially on countries in Africa and places where we work.  We'll continue to expand as time allows.

### Data Source

This project uses admin boundary data from [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org).  To get this data we are using the awesome [Mapzen Borders](https://mapzen.com/data/borders/) project.

Why OSM?  OSM admin boundary data is by no means perfect.  However, they represent one of the best non-propietary sources of data out there.  Promoting their use creates additional incentive for people to improve them too.

### Contribute

If you see a country missing please add it and send a pull request. Alternately, you can contact us via a ticket and we'll help faciliate getting your data added.

To generate these files we are using the very handy R script [TabShapeR](https://github.com/msolbrig/TabShapeR).
